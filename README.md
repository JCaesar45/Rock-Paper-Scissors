# Rock Paper Scissors Challenge

## Overview
This project consists of implementing a strategy for the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against four different bots. Your objective is to create a player function in `RPS.py` that wins at least 60% of matches against each bot. The project is designed to enhance your understanding of programming concepts, strategy development, and possibly basic elements of machine learning.

## Project Structure

```
/rock-paper-scissors
    ├── RPS.py              # Your player function goes here
    ├── RPS_game.py         # Contains the game logic and bots (Do not modify this file)
    ├── main.py             # Entry point for testing your player function
    └── test_module.py      # Contains unit tests to verify your implementation
```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   To begin, you can clone the repository to your local machine or use Gitpod.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd rock-paper-scissors
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: 
   Ensure you have the necessary environment set up. If there are any specific libraries needed, they will be mentioned in the project's requirements.

3. **Open RPS.py**:
   The main logic for your player goes into `RPS.py`. Inside, there is a function template provided:

   ```python
   def player(prev_play, opponent_history=[]):
       # Your game logic goes here
   ```

   - `prev_play`: This argument denotes the opponent's last move (`"R"`, `"P"`, or `"S"`).
   - `opponent_history`: This optional argument allows you to keep track of past moves if necessary.

4. **Implement Your Strategy**:
   Develop a strategy that can win at least 60% of the games against each of the four bots. You may need to implement multiple strategies that adapt based on your opponent's previous moves.

## Testing Your Code

To test your implementation, you can run the game directly from `main.py`. The play function allows you to simulate matches between your player and the bots. Use it like this:

```python
from RPS_game import play, quincy  # example for importing the game logic and a bot

# Example match
play(player, quincy, 1000, verbose=True)
```

### Running Unit Tests

The project includes unit tests in `test_module.py`. You can run these tests to quickly verify if your implementation is functioning correctly.

1. Open `main.py`.
2. Uncomment the line that triggers the unit tests.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will execute your player function against predefined test cases to check its behavior.

## Submission

Once you are satisfied with your implementation:

1. Push your changes to your version control.
2. Copy the URL of your project repository.
3. Submit the URL to freeCodeCamp as required.

## Conclusion

Good luck with your implementation of the Rock Paper Scissors bot! Remember that developing a winning strategy can be a fun challenge. Explore various techniques, and don't hesitate to iterate on your design. Happy coding!
